As of my last update in **June 2024**, here are some of the key areas where significant progress was being made and continues to evolve:\n\n**Key Areas of New Developments in Drug Discovery (up to mid-2024):**\n\n*   **AI-Powered Generative Models for Molecule Design:**\n    *   **De Novo Design:** AI models (like Generative Adversarial Networks - GANs, Variational Autoencoders - VAEs, and diffusion models) are not just optimizing existing molecules but are capable of designing entirely novel molecular structures from scratch that have desired properties (e.g., binding affinity to a specific target, good pharmacokinetic profiles).\n    *   **Target-Specific Design:** These generative models can be trained to design molecules specifically for challenging or previously \"undruggable\" targets.\n\n*   **Accelerated Hit Identification and Lead Optimization:**\n    *   **Virtual Screening Enhancements:** AI algorithms are making virtual screening (testing millions of compounds computationally) much faster and more accurate, prioritizing the most promising candidates for experimental testing.\n    *   **Property Prediction Improvements:** AI models are getting better at predicting a wide range of crucial properties for potential drugs, including toxicity, solubility, metabolic stability, and efficacy, thereby reducing the number of candidates that fail later in development.\n\n*   **Drug Repurposing with AI:**\n    *   **New Algorithms for Finding Connections:** AI is being used to sift through vast amounts of biological data (genomic, proteomic, clinical trial data) to identify existing drugs that could be effective against new diseases. This significantly shortens the development timeline and reduces costs.\n\n*   **AI in Target Identification and Validation:**\n    *   **Uncovering Novel Disease Mechanisms:** AI can analyze complex biological networks and omics data to identify previously unknown disease pathways and pinpoint novel protein targets that can be modulated by drugs.\n    *   **Predicting Target Druggability:** AI is helping researchers assess early on if a newly identified target is likely to be responsive to drug intervention.\n\n*   **Advancements in Protein Folding and Structure Prediction (e.g., AlphaFold):**\n    *   **Impact on Drug Design:** While AlphaFold's initial breakthrough was a few years ago, its continuous improvements and integration into drug discovery workflows are profound. Knowing the precise 3D structure of target proteins is crucial for designing drugs that bind effectively. This technology is enabling more rational drug design.\n\n*   **AI for Synthesis Planning:**\n    *   **Predicting Reaction Pathways:** AI is being developed to suggest efficient and cost-effective synthetic routes for newly designed molecules, streamlining the process of actually making these compounds in the lab.\n\n*   **Integration of Multi-Omics Data:**\n    *   **Holistic Understanding:** AI is crucial for integrating data from genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and clinical records to gain a more comprehensive understanding of disease and drug response at a patient level.\n\n*   **AI in Clinical Trial Design and Patient Stratification:**\n    *   **Optimized Trial Protocols:** AI can help design more efficient clinical trials by identifying the most suitable patient populations, predicting trial success rates, and optimizing dosing regimens.\n    *   **Biomarker Discovery:** AI can identify biomarkers that predict patient response to a drug, enabling more personalized treatment strategies and potentially leading to faster regulatory approval.\n\n**Examples of Companies and Research Areas:**\n\nMany biotech startups and established pharmaceutical companies are heavily investing in AI for drug discovery. You'll see terms like \"AI-driven drug discovery,\" \"generative chemistry,\" and \"computational drug design\" frequently in their announcements.\n\n**In summary, the trend is towards AI not just accelerating existing drug discovery processes but fundamentally transforming how new medicines are conceived, designed, and brought to patients.**\n\nTo get the absolute newest developments, you would need to look at recent publications in scientific journals and press releases from companies actively involved in this space.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the second development I mentioned in my previous response about AI in drug discovery, which was **\"Accelerated Hit Identification and Lead Optimization.\"**\n\nLet me elaborate on that:\n\n**What is Hit Identification and Lead Optimization?**\n\nBefore AI, these were typically the most time-consuming and expensive phases of early drug discovery.\n\n*   **Hit Identification:** This is the process of finding initial molecules (called \"hits\") that show some desired biological activity against a specific disease target. This often involves screening vast libraries of chemical compounds.\n*   **Lead Optimization:** Once you have promising \"hits,\" you need to refine them to improve their properties. This means making them more potent (work better), more selective (only affect the intended target), less toxic, and have better \"drug-like\" characteristics (like how well they are absorbed and metabolized by the body). Molecules that pass this stage are called \"leads\" and are candidates for further development into actual drugs.\n\n**How AI is Revolutionizing This Phase:**\n\nAI is making significant inroads in both hit identification and lead optimization by:\n\n1.  **Enhanced Virtual Screening:**\n    *   **Traditional Virtual Screening:** Involves using computer simulations to screen millions of chemical compounds against a target's 3D structure or known activity. However, it could be computationally intensive and sometimes returned many false positives.\n    *   **AI's Role:**\n        *   **More Accurate Scoring:** AI models can learn complex relationships between molecular structure and binding affinity, leading to more accurate predictions of which compounds are likely to interact with the target.\n        *   **Ensemble Methods:** Combining predictions from multiple AI models can further improve accuracy and reduce false positives.\n        *   **Active Learning:** AI can learn from the results of experimental screening (both positive and negative) to guide subsequent computational screening, focusing on the most promising chemical spaces.\n\n2.  **Improved Property Prediction:**\n    *   **What Needs Predicting?** For a molecule to be a viable drug, it needs to have a good balance of many properties:\n        *   **Efficacy:** How well it binds to and modulates the target.\n        *   **Selectivity:** Not binding to unintended targets (which can cause side effects).\n        *   **Solubility:** How well it dissolves in biological fluids.\n        *   **Permeability:** How well it crosses cell membranes to reach its target.\n        *   **Metabolism:** How the body breaks it down.\n        *   **Toxicity:** Whether it's harmful to cells or organs.\n        *   **Pharmacokinetics (PK):** How the drug moves through the body (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion).\n        *   **Pharmacodynamics (PD):** How the drug affects the body.\n    *   **AI's Role:**\n        *   **Predicting Multiple Properties Simultaneously:** AI models can be trained to predict a whole suite of these properties from a molecule's structure, often much faster than experimental assays.\n        *   **Identifying Trade-offs:** AI can help researchers understand the trade-offs between different properties. For example, a molecule that is very potent might be less soluble. AI can help navigate these trade-offs to find the optimal balance.\n        *   **\"Digital Twins\" of Molecules:** In essence, AI provides a way to create a \"digital twin\" of a molecule, allowing researchers to explore its potential behavior and properties in silico before committing to expensive lab work.\n\n3.  **Generative Chemistry in Lead Optimization:**\n    *   **Beyond Screening:** Instead of just screening existing libraries, AI can now *design* new molecules that are predicted to have better properties than existing hits.\n    *   **Iterative Design:** AI models can iteratively suggest modifications to a hit molecule, each time aiming to improve one or more desired properties while maintaining others. This creates a guided, intelligent path towards optimizing leads.\n\n**Benefits of AI in this Phase:**\n\n*   **Speed:** Reduces the time it takes to move from identifying a target to having optimized drug candidates from years to potentially months.\n*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** By reducing the number of failed experiments and focusing resources on the most promising molecules, AI lowers the overall cost of drug discovery.\n*   **Higher Success Rates:** By making more informed decisions early on and designing better molecules, AI has the potential to increase the success rate of drugs entering clinical trials.\n*   **Exploring Novel Chemical Space:** AI can explore chemical structures that human intuition might overlook, leading to truly novel drug candidates.\n\nThis area is particularly active because it directly addresses bottlenecks that have historically plagued drug development. Many companies are built around specific AI platforms designed to excel in this crucial early stage.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about companies at the forefront of **AI-driven drug discovery, specifically focusing on accelerated hit identification and lead optimization.** This is a very dynamic space, with both established pharmaceutical giants and specialized AI biotech startups making significant contributions.\n\nHere's a breakdown of key players, categorized for clarity:\n\n**1.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
